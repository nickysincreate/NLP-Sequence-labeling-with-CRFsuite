# NLP-Sequence-labeling-with-CRFsuite
Created a system for sequence labelling which worked on Switchboard(SWBD) corpus which consist of two-person telephone conversations and trained a model using machine learning technique of Conditional Random Fields.
•	Worked on assigning dialogue act to sequence of utterances in the conversations.
•	Created a baseline and advanced set of features to train the data
•	Used CRFsuite toolkit for training the model based on the set of features fed to it.
•	The accuracy rate achieved with baseline features was 72% and with advanced features was 73%.
